        <li><strong>Media and Storage Access:</strong> MediaSweep requires access to your device’s media files to scan for duplicate images and videos. This access is limited to local file scanning and does not involve uploading or sharing your media files.</li>
        <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> The Application does not collect precise (GPS-based) location data from your device. Third-party services may collect approximate location information (derived from IP addresses) for the purposes of analytics and service improvements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>

    <p>The Application integrates third-party services that may collect, store, and use your data. These services have their own Privacy Policies. You are encouraged to review their privacy policies:</p>

    <p><strong>Partnership with Microsoft Clarity and Microsoft Advertising:</strong> We partner with Microsoft Clarity and Microsoft Advertising to capture how you interact with the Application through behavioral metrics, heatmaps, and session replay. This data is captured using cookies and tracking technologies for site optimization, fraud/security purposes, and advertising.</p>
    <p>For more information about how Microsoft collects and uses your data, please visit their Privacy Statement.</p>

    <h2>4. Disclosure of Information</h2>

    <p>The Service Provider may disclose your information in the following circumstances:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> If required by law (e.g., subpoena, legal process, or governmental request), or if we believe disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, safety, or the safety of others.</li>
        <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> To trusted third-party service providers who work on our behalf and agree to adhere to these Terms and Conditions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Opt-Out Rights</h2>

    <p>You can stop all collection of information by the Application by uninstalling it. You may use the standard uninstall process available through your mobile device or application marketplace.</p>

    <p>The Service Provider does not guarantee that the Application will always be compatible with your operating system. However, we will continue to update the Application to ensure functionality.</p>

    <p>The Service Provider may choose to cease providing the Application at any time without notice. Upon termination, your rights to use the Application will end, and you must cease using it.</p>

    <h2>10. Modifications to Terms and Conditions</h2>

    <p>The Service Provider reserves the right to modify these Terms and Conditions at any time. We will notify you of changes by updating this page. It is your responsibility to review these Terms regularly. Continued use of the Application after changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.</p>
