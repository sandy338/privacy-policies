        <h1>Privacy Policy for QR Code Studio Pro</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 16, 2025</p>

        <p>This privacy policy outlines the practices of <strong>Techflyer</strong> ("we", "us", or "our") regarding the QR Code Studio Pro application ("the Application"). We are firmly committed to protecting your privacy. Our guiding principle is simple: your data is your own.</p>

        <h2>Our Core Privacy Principle: We Collect No Data</h2>
        <p>QR Code Studio Pro is designed from the ground up to be a secure, private utility. We believe you have the right to create content without worrying about who is watching.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No User Accounts:</strong> The application does not require you to sign up, log in, or provide any personal information to use its features.</li>
            <li><strong>Local Processing:</strong> All QR code generation is performed <strong>exclusively on your device</strong>. The information you enter (whether it's text, a website URL, Wi-Fi credentials, contact details, or any other supported type) is never sent to our servers or any third-party service.</li>
            <li><strong>No Analytics or Tracking:</strong> The app does not collect any analytics, diagnostics, or usage data. We do not track how you use the app.</li>
            <li><strong>No Permissions Required:</strong> The application does not require any special permissions on Windows to run. It functions as a self-contained tool.</li>
            <li><strong>No Third-Party Services:</strong> QR Code Studio Pro does not integrate with any third-party services, SDKs, or APIs for analytics, advertising, or crash reporting.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data You Create</h2>
        <p>The QR code files you generate and save are your own. When you choose to save a QR code, the application uses the standard Windows "Save As" dialog. The files are stored locally on your device only in the location you select. We have no access to these files or any other data on your computer.</p>
        
        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p><strong>Techflyer</strong> does not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. This application is designed for a general audience and does not contain any content unsuitable for children.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
