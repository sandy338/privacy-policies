        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 16, 2025</p>

        <p>Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms") carefully before using the QR Code Studio Pro macOS application ("the Application") operated by <strong>Techflyer</strong> ("us", "we", or "our").</p>
        
        <p>Your access to and use of the Application is conditioned upon your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all users who purchase, download, or use the Application. By accessing or using the Application, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you do not have permission to use the Application.</p>

        <h2>1. Grant of License</h2>
        <p>Upon your purchase of the Application, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to download, install, and use the Application for your personal and commercial purposes, strictly in accordance with these Terms and the Apple App Store Usage Rules.</p>

        <h2>2. User Conduct and Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>You, the user, are solely responsible for the data and content you encode into the QR codes you generate using the Application. This includes, but is not limited to, text, website URLs, contact information, Wi-Fi credentials, and calendar events.</p>
        <p>You agree not to use the Application to create QR codes that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Link to or contain any content that is illegal, malicious, harmful, fraudulent, or deceptive.</li>
            <li>Infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others (e.g., copyright, trademark).</li>
            <li>Are used for spamming, phishing, or any other unauthorized commercial activities.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content you create. The Application operates entirely locally on your device, and we do not monitor, review, or store any of your generated content.</p>

        <h2>3. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>The Application, including its original code, features, functionality, design, and branding (the "Intellectual Property"), is and will remain the exclusive property of <strong>Techflyer</strong>. Our Intellectual Property may not be used in connection with any product or service without our prior written consent.</p>
        <p>The QR code image files (e.g., PNG files) that you generate and download are your own property, and you may use them as you see fit, subject to your responsibilities outlined in Section 2.</p>

        <h2>4. Termination</h2>
        <p>We may terminate or suspend your license to use the Application immediately, without prior notice or liability, if you breach these Terms.</p>
        <p>Upon termination, your right to use the Application will immediately cease.</p>

        <h2>5. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
        <p>The Application is provided to you "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE," with all faults and defects without warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, we expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory, or otherwise, with respect to the Application.</p>
        <p>We do not warrant that the Application will meet your requirements, achieve any intended results, be compatible with any other software, operate without interruption, or be error-free. We do not guarantee that generated QR codes will be scannable by all devices, applications, or under all conditions.</p>

        <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall we be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, data, or other intangibles, arising out of or in connection with your use or inability to use the Application or the QR codes you create.</p>
        <p>Our total liability to you for any damages arising from or related to these Terms or the Application shall not exceed the amount you paid for the Application.</p>

        <h2>7. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which we are based, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
