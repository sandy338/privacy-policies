    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services & SDKs</h2>
    <p>We use third-party services to help operate the App and analyze usage. These services may collect information as described below and are governed by their own privacy policies:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Firebase (Google)</strong> — used for authentication, push notifications, analytics, crash reporting, and basic data storage. Firebase may collect device identifiers, usage events, and diagnostic data. See Firebase privacy details: <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Microsoft Clarity</strong> — used for session analytics and understanding user interactions to improve usability. Clarity may collect anonymous interaction data and session recordings. See Microsoft Clarity privacy: <a href="https://clarity.microsoft.com/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://clarity.microsoft.com/terms</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">Note: We do not use third-party services to sell personal or health data. Third-party providers act as processors and their use is limited to service provision and analytics as described above.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing & Disclosure</h2>

    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect personal and health data from unauthorized access, disclosure, or misuse. However, no transmission or storage method is 100% secure — absolute security cannot be guaranteed.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain personal and health information only as long as necessary to provide the App’s services, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. You may request deletion in accordance with Section 8.</p>
